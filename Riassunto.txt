Path-Based Dominant-Set Clustering

Combining path-based similarity measures with dominant-set approach:
- Clustering -> good at finding clusters of arbitrary shapes, bad with noisy background
- Dominant-set -> good at dealing with noisy background, bad with not compact clusters

Dominant set clustering
Data is represented as a undirected positive weighted graph with no self loops G = (V, E, w).
Edges represent neighborhood relationships and the weights on edges represent the similarity between pairs of linked nodes.
